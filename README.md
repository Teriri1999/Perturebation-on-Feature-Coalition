# Perturebation-on-Feature-Coalition
Implementation of paper "Perturbation on Feature Coalition: Towards Interpretable Deep Neural Networks"

# Abstract
The inherent "black box" nature of deep neural networks (DNNs) compromises their transparency and reliability. Recently, explainable AI (XAI) has garnered increasing attention from researchers. Several perturbation-based interpretations have emerged. However, these methods often fail to adequately consider feature dependencies. To solve this problem, we introduce a perturbation-based interpretation guided by feature coalitions, which leverages deep information of network to extract correlated features. Then, we proposed a carefully-designed consistency loss to guide network interpretation. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
